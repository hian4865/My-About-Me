            <h2 style="width: auto;"> About me: </h2>
            <p>I am a small town gamer who has always had a dream of creating his own game. I wish to one day create a game that would have the same impact on the indie game industry as some of the bigger titles, like <b>Undertale</b> and <b>Hollow Knight</b>. Something that would invoke great amounts of emotion in people.</p>
