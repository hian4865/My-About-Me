            <h2>A list of the three projects I made!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A profile picture with a Border,Circular shape, and a hover effect!</li>
                    <li>A style quote box that displays a quote from the character in the profile picture.</li>
                    <li>A styled list that centers around the things that I like about the game said character is from, and what things I would like to adopt into my own game.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I chose these three projects specifically to go into more detail about the kind of style of games I like and would like to develop, and to display a character whose writing quality I would like to match if not outright surpass with my games writing.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Qualities from Fallout: New Vegas.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Writing Style: It leads the player to always think of new and clever ways to go about the story, and doesn't lock you into any specific route.</li>
                    <li>The Art Direction: The art direction of a hostile and bleak desert wasteland has always stood out to me as a fun scope to take and a fun land to play in. This is something that I would love to convey in at least one of my future games.</li>
                    <li>The RPG Mechanics: The Perks, Skills, and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. systems in Fallout: New Vegas make the game a true rpg, where no matter what character build you play it is still a viable build and actually allows you to roleplay your character to the fullest extent.</li>
                    <li>The DLCs: The DLCs of Fallout: New Vegas have always stood out to me no matter what other game I play because of how vastly different each one is. They all feel like their own adventure and worldspace within this shared world and yet somehow stand out, even in comparison to the others.</li>
                </ul>
